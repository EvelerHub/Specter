# Want to contribute to the project?
This project is meant to be open and friendly to both new developers and old. The following are some guidelines for how to get started.

## First: Install and Run Specter
This is one of the best places to get started. Please check out the INSTALLATION.md file for detailed instructions on how to install and run Specter.

## Coding Style Guidelines
Because Specter is a Python project, we use [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). Please try to adhere to these guidelines as much as possible. The only major exception is for line length, I don't mind if you have up to 120 characters per line, but be courteous. If a Pull Request is submitted that completely ignores these guidelines I will reject it. However, if it's close enough or only a quick fix to get it right, I will be happy to fix it and merge it.

## First-Timers-Only or New Developers
It is important to me to offer guidance and assistantship for new developers. As a result I will make a concerted effort to provide opportunities to those groups. If you fit in one of these categories, then welcome! I'm happy to have you here. Please check out the Issue tracker for issues that have tags like 'good first issue' or 'first-timers-only'. Those issues will be explicit and try to clearly define what you can do to help. If you get lost, or the instructions aren't clear, feel free to comment and I will be happy to walk through it with you. :)

## How to File a Bug Report
Did you find a bug or problem with the code? Let me know! The best way to do this would be to submit an Issue with the 'bug' tag. In the issue, please describe very thoroughly what the issue is. If you'd like to fix it yourself, feel free to mention that in your comment and I will be happy to review any Pull Requests you submit :)

## How to Suggest a New Feature
Do you have a feature you'd recommend? The best way to submit a Feature Request would be through creating a new Issue with the 'enhancement' tag. In the issue, please describe very thoroughly what you'd like to see implemented. If you'd like to do it yourself, feel free to mention that in your comment and I will be happy to review any Pull Requests you submit.

## Rules for Submitting a Pull Request
At this time, there is no development branch. As a result, you will need to merge directly into the master. As the project grows, I will eventually implement a development branch (likely when the project hits a 1.0 release).

## Where Should I Find Things to Work On?
The best place to find things that need to be done would be in the Issue Tracker. Here will be some examples of things you can do to help out. Additionally, check out the Projects tab for anything else that is being worked on (please only work on things in the To Do list).
