### What is Specter?
Specter is a prototype cryptocurrency designed to help people learn about Blockchain Technology. It is entirely open source and is developed using Python 2.7

**What makes Specter unique as a cryptocurrency?:** Unlike most cryptocurrencies, Specter isn't trying to become an ICO or get sold on an exchange. Instead, Specter is a research project focused on overcoming the technical challenges of Blockchain technology.

### Do You Accept New Developers on the Project?
YES! Absolutely! I am happy to help new developers on their path to contribute to open source. Please see our contributing guidelines as to how to get started.
