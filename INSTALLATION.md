## How To Install and Run Specter
Please be aware that Specter uses Python 2.7. This may change in the future, but for right now that is what we are using.

Installing Specter is rather easy depending on your operating system.

* First: Install Pip (Depends on your operating system, see [this](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/))
* Second: Be sure to install all the dependencies above (Those commands should help you install)
* Third: Clone the repo to your local machine (git clone https://github.com/Frichetten/Specter.git)
* Fourth: Run the webserver.py first so that you have a local node.
* Fifth: Run the multiwallet.py to create a wallet.
